**Notes on this lesson**

In my opinion this lesson is irrelevant to most of us mutually doing this course unless they want to read through it and practice setting up their own discord server. 

It goes through the basics of channel permissions vs category permissions and roles.

Not really worth a discussion during the weekly meetings on this if you ask me.
