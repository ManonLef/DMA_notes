## **Discord Moderation Academy Notes**

I'm using this repo to keep notes on the Discord Academy lessons. I decided to make this a repo so my teammates can see this as well.

I keep track of questions I'd like to discuss with the team as well as a summary of noteworthy points from the lessons.

I'm also keeping track of random ideas or inspiration (applicable to our community) that were sparked by reading the specific lesson. 

This is also a good way for me to learn more about Markdown so I'll take that as a bonus.
