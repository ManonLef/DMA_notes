**Questions from going through this lesson**

- Are we utilizing reporting to Discord at all?
- Do we want to report extreme offenses to Discord like [^1];
	- Spam
	- Age < 13
	- Adult Content in Profiles
	- Basically everything against Discord Community Guidelines.
- Does iOS reporting need an additional ticket sent in afterwards through the Online Form?
- How often do raids even occur on Discord? Did our server ever have those? Are we protected?
	- My research: Raids often occur on alts, we have a layer of protection against that already with our phone verification.

**Noteworthy**

- Screenshots are usually not accepted in most cases when reporting.
- Messages that are deleted and NOT reported will be lost forever and you will be unable to use them as evidence.
- During raids it's enough to copy a bunch of ID's

**Summary Methods of Reporting**

1. DAR/DnR = Delete and Report
	- If we want to delete a message (not on iOS) we can turn on this option as shown in the above image.
	- If you DAR messages, you should also be sure to complete a full report using the Online form below.

2. Online Form
	- [Online form](https://dis.gd/request)
	- Message IDs entered into the form will not be saved when the message is deleted unless you use DAR.
3. iOS Reporting
	- Long click a message on iOS device to see the *report* button. 
	- Similar to DAR but doesn't get deleted. 
	- After submitting report, you can delete the message.

**Random Inspiration from this Lesson**

- If we ever get to making a Beginner's guide, Discord Safety Center has some good recommendations on safety [here](https://discord.com/safety/360043857751-Four-steps-to-a-super-safe-account) including not clicking links, protecting your account etc. 
- Suggestion for mods: use a clipboard manager on your desktop so you have a quick way to copy and retrieve User Id's, message links and more. I use CopyClip - Clipboard History from the Mac Appstore. It's a lifesaver with all the moderation zap steps.


[^1]: Especially in the case of spam, fake nitro links etc. This seems impossible with message ID's if we let the bot delete. We could consider screenshots of auto-deleted messages and user ID's instead. 

[^2]: During testing this iOS feature it seemed to me that the 'report' talked about came at the end of the report sequence. No ticket option there. Seems like an additional step needed.
